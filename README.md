- ⚡ Fun fact: AI programs like neural networks and machine learning models can often "teach themselves" to perform tasks they weren’t explicitly programmed for! For example, OpenAI's GPT was trained to predict the next word in a sentence but has learned to perform tasks like translating languages, writing code, and answering complex questions—tasks it wasn’t directly programmed for. This self-learning ability is one of the key aspects of AI that makes it both fascinating and powerful!
